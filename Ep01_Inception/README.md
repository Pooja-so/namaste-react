# Namaste React ðŸš€

# Parcel (Makes development environment smooth ðŸŒŠ)

- Development(dev) Build
- Creates Local Server and hosts dev build to that sever
- Automatically refreshing your web page.
- HMR = Hot Module Replacement
- Hot reloading: When you make a change, Parcel automatically updates your code in the browser â€“ no page reload(refresh) necessary!
- Parcel uses File Warching Algorithm( Written in c++) to perform HMR
- Gives faster development experience as it uses caching (parcel is caching things in .parcel-cache which results in reducing the time to referesh and run code next time i.e. after making changes)

------Useful Production purpose tak done by Parcel----------
- Image optimization
- Minifying the code
- Bundling
- Compression


- Consistent hashing(Read about it)
- Code splitting 
- Differential bundling - To support older browser
- Diagnostics
- Good Error Handling
-Right now the app is hosted on http. parcel gives you the ability to host the app on https 
- Tree shaking : Remove unused code for you
- Different dev bundles and prod bundles (As produc build takes more time than dev builds because more optimization is neede in production build than development build)
